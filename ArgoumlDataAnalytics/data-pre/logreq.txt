R549	Enumeration data types should be represented on the class diagram Enumeration data types  the only data types users can create  should be able to be placed on the class diagram 
R2225	Allow the user to create diagrams without selecting a classifier or operation This issue requests the following enhancement: Allow the user to create diagrams without selecting a classifier operation first The UML standard says that a Collaboration diagram needs  can not exist without  at least a  Classifier  or  Operation    if I interpret the standard well  But a user should be able to start ArgoUML and draw some Collaboration diagrams  without first defining e g  a class  The same applies to e g  a Statechart diagram  Which would mean that  formally  the user is making a mistake here  There are many ways to handle  user mistakes  with varying degrees of user friendlyness  One such way is to not allow him to do so  by e g  downlighting toolbuttons  Another way  in which ArgoUML excells  is to allow the mistake  and warn the user with a critic  which is a non obstructive way   and give hime the possibility to correct the error  Hence the following proposal: 1  Do not downlight the collaboration   statechart diagram creation functions any more   never  2  Create a critic to warn for a missing classifier operation modelelement for these diagrams  3  Allow the user to change the namespace   represented xxx of a collaboration   statemachine 
R2712	Association Role name should be hidden rather than show AssociationRole name on the collaboration diagram should be hidden rather than show  if the name is empty and no bases has been assigned   Or it could be left empty  which would look very much the same  might perhaps still be clickable then which I don not know if it is a good thing or not 
R3197	Implement CallState This issue requests to implement Call States Currently  CallState is not yet implemented  since the UML1 3 spec only defines it as:  A call state is an action state that has exactly one call action as its entry action    but there is no special notation defined  Hence implementing it would beter wait till UML 1 4  where its notation is specified as:  A call state is shown in the same way as an action state  except that the name of the operation of the call action is put in the symbol  along with the name of the classifier that hosts the operation in parentheses under it  
R3350	Double click on edge should edit its name Double clicking on a textual annotation of an edge  such as the association name  places ArgoUML into edit mode on that text  However if that text is currently blank it is not possible to see where to double click  I would like double clicking the edge itself to go to edit mode for the edges that have some name annotation  For the association edge I would like this to include editing association end name by double clicking the line end 
R3631	Perspectives settings should be included in settings menu The  perspectives  settings for the Explorer is too well hidden   It should be included in the general Settings dialog at a minimum 
R3711	Strip diagrams from poseidon *.xmi file tried loading an XMI formatted file that was created with poseidon UML and received the following beauty 
R3773	Usability: tree should not be closed when switching perspectives It is annoying that the explorer tree is closed after switching to a new perspective  It would be nice if the root node would be reopened 
R4005	Make activity graph context assignment easier I am using the Argouml with Andromda extension  One thing required by Andromda is to assign a controller class as the context of an activity graph by adding a tag like these  as quote from Andromda  no s guide  Add a tagged value to the controller  pointing to the use case  like this : andromda presentation controller usecase My Use Case   the value is the name of : the use case  I noticed with or without setting this tag  the exported xmi file from argouml has the following tag within the activity tag UML State Machine context UML Use Case xmi idref   no UML State Machine context where it references the Use Case  Is there a way to change the context to point to the controller class
R4137	Deleting element while editing tagged values causes exceptions The Stereotype Prop panel should show a field for extended Elements Extended Element: Designates the model elements affected by the stereotype  Each one must be a model element of the kind specified by the base Class attribute 
R1641	Explorer option for creating diagrams from elements useful where you lost never had a class diagram for a particular package 
R1942	Enhance ArgoUML by support for Model. Sub system. Element Import  enhance ArgoUML to support Model  Subsystem and ElementImport   create relevant Figs and improve or add PropertyPanels   give possibility to add  define and remove ElementImport relations between elements    make property panels for Packages acknowledge that they are generalizable elements
R1183	Support Java notation parsing for editing on the diagram Support Java notation parsing for editing on the diagram Create a class and an operation  attribute also  Put the diagram notation in java mode  Edit the operation by double clicking on it: write say public int new Operation   Notice that the UML parser in ParserDisplay is used  and that it of  course does not speak java so the edit fails 
R1802	Show association name on a Link in the diagram Show association name on a Link in the diagram Neither on links between nodes nor on links between components do the names given to these links appear in the diagram  Related note: How can I create stereotypes to be used for such links
R4010	Add buttons for trigger. guard and effect on the properties panel of a transition Add buttons for trigger  guard and effect on the properties panel of a transition  I m trying to set the guard in a transition in a state diagram  but I don t know how to set it  I ve found a mail in the archives telling that if you set the description of the transition to a text of the form  trigger [guard] effect  the text gets parsed and the attributes of the transition get filled  but I don t know where to write such a text  I ve tried in the Name field with no success   Any ideas  using v0 20    I just discovered it: you may select the desired transition and start typing  or you may right click on Trigger  Guard or Effect to get a contextual menu where you can create a new trigger  guard or event   I find the later not that much intuitive  so maybe a button could be included to make this more explicit  Compared to creating an operation for a class: There are 2 toolbuttons for this  one on the diagram toolbar  and one on the proppanel  but no popup menu  We should follow this design for trigger guard effect 
R4292	ability to move to next or prev argument of method When editing an argument from a method I miss the ability to move up down the list of arguments for a method I now have to move up to the owning method   then select the next argument  A similar feature can be used when editing  classes  properties and classes  fields enumeration  items e g  Notice that a similar feature already exists  When editing a association  there is a feature  button   that allows you to switch between both ends  
R440	Actors (and others) in static structure One should be able to add actors  and I belive all other classifiers to a  static structure diagram  aka Class Diagram  
R1009	Create UML objects in Explorer Currently most UML objects can be only created on a diagram  Exceptions to this are datatypes and stereotypes   It would be very  useful to be able to create an element directly in the navigation panel  through the context menu  probably through a  Create     menu giving a  submenu of choices 
R1308	Hide or show toolbars Right click  on the tool bar are should provide a drop down menu of check box items to hide show each tool bar  should also be available from view menu  If all tool bars are hidden then the tool bar area should close up 
R1860	Allow diagrams to be moved between packages in explorer Allow diagrams to be moved between packages in explorer In a new project I started  I originally used the default class diagram for my data model classes   I ve now decided I d prefer that diagram to appear within the package in the package hierarchy  on the Package centric view  that contains those classes; I know it s possible to have it in there as I can create a new diagram there with no problem  but I can t find any way to move the existing one   The edit menu s cut copy & paste options are disabled when I select it in the explorer  and I don t really want to have to hack around in the XMI file with a text editor   
R2501	Implement the missing tabs in the  Find  dialog Figure out the purpose  design the UI and implement the missing tabs in  the  Find  dialog  Alternatively  remove them 
R3110	Addition of swim lanes to activity diagram Swam lanes would be a nice addition to ArgoUML to allow better organization of activity diagrams  One place they are shown is http:  www agilemodeling com artifacts activityDiagram htm   This allows veritical or horizontal lines separating various actors and the system within an activity diagram  Hopefully it s a simple addition  
R3208	Selection of default diagram after load It would be very nice to have a possibility to set which diagram is shown directly after load of a project  I have a project with 7 class diagrams and I always get the wrong one  at least always the same  after loading the project 
R3422	Add popup menuitem Show to Path  The Path setting is present on the Presentation tab for all node model elements  and is persistent  It shows the path behind a  ::    try e g  with a class inside a package This kind of setting normally require a popup menu item: Show    Show Path and Show    Hide Path  One of these is to be shown appropriately 
R4252	Support Derived elements notation 3 52 Derived Element 3 52 1 Semantics A derived element is one that can be computed from another one  but that is shown for clarity or that is included for design purposes even though it adds no semantic information  3 52 2 Notation A derived element is shown by placing a slash  in front of the name of the derived element  such as an attribute or a rolename  This is especially usefull on associations and attributes The  derived  is a standard tagged value defined for ModelElement 
R4569	Object Flow State prop panel does not show  Is Synch  The Object Flow State properties panel does not show the  Is Synch  boolean  A single checkmark will do Is Synch: A boolean value indicating whether an object flow state is used as a synch state 
R4570	Object Flow State prop panel does not show parameters  The UML standard says:parameter: Designates parameters that provide the object as output or take it as input 
R4774	Extend move up down with move top bottom The ordering of attributes  association ends  operations  owned elements in a class can be altered with a  move up  and  move down    Please implement a  move to top  and  move to  bottom   this will allow for much faster ordering  Please also implement key bindings for doing the above four mentioned operations  Perhaps some meta key with up  down  home and end keys when the list to be sorted has been selected or has focus 
R4824	Enabling source tab for all models and figures  We need to enable the source tab for all the models or figures and have the  java source be empty for those models or figures which are not class model or  figure  We used models and figures other than class model or figure to represent database entities such as schemas  and more   but we cannot show the generated statements because we cannot easily extend and instantiate org argouml uml ui TabSrc That is because TabSrc is internally instantiated through a java reflection and it seems to not be possible to instantiated it outside of argouml code 
R4876	Modules can not add elements to the UI Before svn revision r13614  the modules were loaded after the UI  but the  argouml team decided to load the modules before the UI  the model modules require that   We must provide an API to module developers for adding elements  menu bar  tool bar  to the ArgoUML UI 
R4969	Hide association names in diagramm when there are many associations. the diagram is unreadable Add  Show association names  to Project and and Argo settings  Notation tab  just after  Show guillemots   default value is  true on   Don t show association text  return empty string  in Association Name Notation Uml to String  
R4989	Blurred alt tab icon The argouml application icon has been updated  The icon on the task bar and title bar are displayed correctly   However  in WinXP  and possibly other OSs   the icon shown during alt tab task switching is blurred  see attached image  Expected cause: 16x16 icon is being scaled up to 32x32  The icon displayed during alt tab task switching should be 32x32 
R5000	Create a EnumerationLiteralNotation The Fig Enumeration Literals Compartment currently uses the Model Element Name Notation to handle the text shown for the Literals on an Enumeration  But an Enumeration Literal should have a different Notation: the Enumeration Literal Notation  The BNF for this case is to be determined as a first step 
R5014	Better indication of default settings vs. project specific settings Some tabs in the Edit     Settings dialog only specify the defaults to be used for new diagrams  These settings are not supposed to influence the current project  This should at least be indicated by a string saying something like  These are default settings which are applied to newly created projects    In addition  there could be a button  Configure project specific settings     which leads to the File     Properties dialog  There are 4 tabs in the settings dialog for which this addition would be good:  User  Profiles  Notations  Diagram Appearance 
R5263	Unload in profile config only works on available profiles. not active ones This happens either in File   Properties   Profiles and in Edit   Settings   Profiles  the intended behavior of the unload button is for unloading only available profiles  but since it appears on the right side of the window it seems it could be used to unload active profiles too Steps to reproduce:1  Go to  File   Properties   Profiles   select a profile in the  active profiles  list 2  Click in the  Unload  button under the  active profiles  list  nothing happens
R4935	Add a JVM heap monitor Add a JVM heap monitor display similar to the ones used by Eclipse or JEdit so that the user can see when they are running low on memory 
R4980	Support relocation of all diagram types The user can invoke this function by drag & drop in the explorer  or by selecting another entry in the  Home Model  combo on the properties panel of the diagram  This means completion of the implementation of the  Relocatable  interface operations in all diagrams
